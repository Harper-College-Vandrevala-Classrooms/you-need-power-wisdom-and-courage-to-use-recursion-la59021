# You Need Power, Wisdom, and Courage When Using Recursion
## by A.J. L.

### Summary
This is a header and program in c++ that inplements methods regarding triangular Numbers.

The inplemented methods are:
- value(int n)
    - This returns the integer value of the nth triangular number.
- add(int n, int m)
    - This returns the interger sum of the nth and mth triangular numbers.
- subtract(int n, int m)
    - This returns the interger differance between the nth and mth triangular numbers.
- multiply(int n, int m)
    - This returns the interger product of the nth and mth triangular numbers
- divide(int n, int m)
    - This returns the double quotient of the nth and mth triangular numbers
- sequence(int n)
    - This returns a list containing all integer triangular numbers from 1 to n.

### Compilation
To compile the main program, that takes 2 user inputs and prints the results of using the new methods on the inputs, use the command 
> make 1

To complile the test program, that preforms unit tests on all the new methods, use the command
> make 2
